AIT QKD R10 Demo-Setup
======================

This folder contains a full setup for two machines. 


1. Copy and create the folders at the locations found herin on the alice and bob machines.


2. Ensure both machines can find each other. Let your /etc/hosts file look something like this:

    127.0.0.1   localhost

    # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
    ::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

    # demo hosts
    10.0.0.54       alice
    10.0.0.55       bob

Check the last lines and try to ping both machines from both locations. That is

    user@alice $ ping alice
    ...
    user@alice $ ping bob
    ...
    
and

    user@bob $ ping alice
    ...
    user@bob $ ping bob
    ...

should succeed.


3. Create a set of input keys using the qkd-demo-keys script. Copy the peer key file to the peer (as depicted by the output of qkd-demo-keys).


4. Launch the qkd-pipeline on both machines:

    user@alice $ qkd-pipeline alice
    
and

    user@bob $ qkd-pipeline bob
    

5. Check the resulting key "final_keys.alice" or "final_keys.bob" in the current folder.


6. Any logs will be written to /var/log/qkd/TIMESTAMP with TIMESTAMP having the date in format YYYYMMDD_hhmm of the launch.
