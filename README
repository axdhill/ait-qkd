AIT QKD RX Software
===================


This is the AIT QKD Software Suite containing Q3P, the Q3P KeyStore, QKD Modules, Cascade, and others.

The source code is arranged as a CMake (see: http://www.cmake.org/) project.

1. Preparation
--------------

1.1 For compilation
-------------------

In order to compile the QKD sources we need at least the developer versions of:

    - gcc and g++ at least version 4.6.3
    - boost at least version 1.49
    - OpenSSL
    - UUID
    - CMake
    - GMP
    - 0MQ (Zero Message Queue) version 2.2 (NOT version 3)
    - Qt4 at least version 4.4
    - Qwt6
    - Doxygen
    - libpcap
    - netcat
    

Here are the steps which help you to setup a build system capable of compiling the sources on a pure Debian Wheezy system.

    # apt-get install build-essential g++ gcc libboost-all-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev cmake libssl-dev uuid-dev libgmp3-dev libzmq-dev libdbus-1-dev libqt4-dev libqwt6 libqwt-dev doxygen libpcap-dev netcat


If you want to use git to clone directly from the AIT servers the source code:
    
    # apt-get install git
    
    (switch back to normal user)
    
    $ git clone http://sqt.ait.ac.at/git/qkd-public.git

    
    
1.2 For package install only
----------------------------

Despite a normal Debian Wheezy implementation you'll need:


    # apt-get install libboost-filesystem1.49.0 libboost-program-options1.49.0 libboost-system1.49.0 libzmq1 libqt4-core libqt4-gui libqt4-network libqt4-dbus libqtdbus4 libqwt6    
    
These are the essential binary runtime packages listened in section "1.1" but for the non-developer version.

    

2. Compilation
--------------

Step into the "build" folder, invoke cmake and then make.

    $ mkdir build 2> /dev/null
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    

    
3. Test
-------

Once you've run sucessful the "make" command you are enabled to run tests at your disposal. To do so switch into the build folder again.

    $ cd build
    $ make test

This will run a series of tests to check the sanity of the qkd sytstem built. If one or more test failed then this is a good indicator that something has gone awry. Please consult the AIT with the output of the command for support.
   


4. Installation
---------------

After a sucessfull build, step into the build folder and call make install (and ldconfig).

    $ cd build
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig
    

        
5. Packaging
------------

After a sucessfull build, you might as well create DEB packages for install on various Debian or Debain-based systems.

    $ cd build
    $ make package
    

6. Installation from DEB
------------------------

You might as well pick a qkd_*.deb file for installation provided by the AIT team. The dependencies are solved by issuing a apt-get install command prior:

    $ sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin libboost-filesystem1.49.0 libboost-program-options1.49.0 libboost-system1.49.0 libzmq1 libqtgui4 libqtdbus4 libqt4-network libqwt6 libpcap0.8
    $ sudo dpkg --install qkd*.deb
