This file holds the changes of the AIT QKD R10 throughout the versions
======================================================================


Changes from 9.9999.3 to 9.9999.4
---------------------------------

* qkd-pipeline supports now "autoconnect"
    
    When set "autoconnect" to "true", then the qkd-pipeline does now
    interconnect each module listened in the order given on the local
    machine.

    That is: it set url_pipe_in and url_pipe_out automatically without
    any need to set this manually by the administrator which is 
    error prone. 

    Additionally arguments in the XML file are "pipein" which defines the
    input pipe socket for the whole pipeline and "pipeout" likewise
    as the output socket for the whole pipe.

    At the same time the 'start="yes"' argument within the module
    definitions of the pipeline config XML has been dropped.

* added qkd-statistics-average tool

    This causes the new python3 dependency

* added qkd-statistics module

* switched to 0MQ 4.0.5

    ATTENTION: this has a heavy impact on the target platforms.
    For Debian based systems this changes from installing libzmq1
    to installing libzmq3.

* qkd-throttle works now again

* module interrupt and terminate is now gracefully again.

* key synchronization has been improved and stabilised.

* added "--debug-message-flow" to modules

    Most AIT QKD modules will now respond to a "--debug-message-flow" command
    line option. This option will pass on the content of received and sent
    messages to the debug output in canonical form.

    Beware: this will tend to heavy growth of the debug file.

* dropped "error bits" field in key stream

    The error bits field in key stream has been cause to many irritations.
    As it does not provide any benefit the AIT QKD team decided to drop
    this field without substitution.

* added local test DBus when running "make test"

    As such there are not failed DBus/X11 messages when running
    plain via SSH.

* added bob_the_builder script for continuous integration

* Bug fixes
