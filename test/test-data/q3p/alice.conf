# On startup each node will look into
# these folders:
#
#   <command-line argument>
#   <current process image path>
#   <installtion_prefix>/share/q3p
#   <installtion_prefix>/etc/q3p
#   /etc/q3p/
#
#   (in this order)
#
# and tries to fetch the configuration file
# with his name on it.
#
# The first file found, serves.
#
# That is: if the node is started as
#
#       # q3pd foo
#
# and the process image resides in /usr/bin
# it will look to get a file called
#
#       /usr/bin/foo.conf
#       /usr/share/q3p/foo.conf
#       /usr/etc/q3p/foo.conf
#       /etc/q3p/foo.conf
#
# All other files in /etc/q3p (or in the found folder) 
# are ignored.
#
# AS THIS FILE CONTAINS THE SHARED SECRET
# IT MUST BE SECURED PROPERLY.
